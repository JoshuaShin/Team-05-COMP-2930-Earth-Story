### What is Earth Story?
Earth Story is an education game that poses critical questions to the player. 
These questions will ask the player think about the decisions they make in the game and in their everyday lives.
The player's earth will visually change to reflect their choices.

### How to Play
The goal of the game is to answer critical questions about the environment and create a balanced world.
Each question will impact four earth status': Environment, Resources, Economy and Society. 
<br/><br/>
The player answers questions until the star in the timeline reaches the end.
If any of the four statuses reach 0, the earth becomes unsustainable and the game ends. 
The score will reflect the choices you make.
